# TeronWarriorTankTools
This is an addon to help warriors manage their tanking better. 

## The first feature is the ability to enable/disable the removal of Power Word: Shield from the Warrior.
It's very easy to use, just click on the minimap button. If the Power Word: Shield icon on the minimap button is green then you will not be shielded by priests (the addon will automatically remove the shields) and if the icon is red then the addon is disabled.

## The second feature which was recently added is the Tank Mode. 
THis feature allows for warriors to choose which Stance to Tank in. Currently Works for Battle and Defensive Stances. Since TWoW introduced a talent which increases your threat in Battle and Berserker Stances, I decided that it would be nice if there was an easier way to choose which stance to tank in without having to change your macros every single time. Using this feature you can just use **"/run TeronTankMode()"** in your macros instead of the ordinary **"/cast ... Stance"** and if the addon is set to Tank Mode then you will automatically switch to Defensive Stance upon casting the macro. If it's disabled then you will use Battle Stance. (Might add an option for Berserker Stance as well in the future!)
